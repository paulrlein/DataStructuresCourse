# Sort Algorithms

## Bubble Sort

* Not a widely used algorithm as the performance degrades with size. 
But it is widely taught as a first sort routine.

* Partition into sorted and unsorted parts

* Large values bubble to the left (assuming low to high)

* In-place algorithm - we are not creating another array
* O(n^2) time complexity - quadratic
It will take 100 steps to sort 10 items, 10000 steps to sort 100 items, etc
* Algoritm degrades quickly
