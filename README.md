# Data Structure Course
In preparation for teaching a class on Data Structures, I am taking a course on Udemy entitled “Data Structures and Algorithms: A Deep Dive using Java”. The material covers Arrays, Sort Algorithms, Big O notation, Lists, Stacks, Queues, Hash Tables, Tree Diagrams, and Search Algorithms. All topics are presented with theory followed by implementation. This repository includes all notes, implementations, and exercises.
